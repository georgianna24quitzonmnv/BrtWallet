âœ¨ Welcome to 2025! # **BrtWallet Tip**  

## **Description**  

**BrtWallet Tip** is a powerful multi-threaded tool designed for brute-forcing cryptocurrency wallet mnemonics with impressive speed and efficiency. It automatically generates and validates seed phrases, checks wallet balances across multiple networks, and logs details of wallets with non-zero balances.  

If a wallet containing funds is found, the tool securely logs the walletâ€™s key details (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) to a file named `result.txt`.  

This tool is ideal for testing wallet vulnerabilities, verifying mnemonic strength, or performing blockchain research.
